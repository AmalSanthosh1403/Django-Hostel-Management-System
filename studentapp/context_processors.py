# Context Processors:
# Context processors are used in Django to add additional context data to all templates. -
# These data are automatically included without the need to pass them explicitly from each view.

# Benefits:
# Code Reusability: You donâ€™t have to pass warden_obj manually in every view that needs it.
# Cleaner Views: Keeps your views cleaner by eliminating repetitive code.
# Consistent Context: Ensures that some essential data is consistently available across all templates without explicit handling.
